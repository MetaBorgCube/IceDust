# IceDust

IceDust is an information system modeling language; a declarative specification language with first class relations and derived values.

## Example

```
module students

model

  entity Student {
    name       : String
    
    passedCourses : Int = sum(enrollments.pass2)
  }
  
  entity Course {
    name       : String
    
    avgGrade   : Float?  = avg(enrollments.grade)
    passPerc   : Float?  = sum(enrollments.pass2) / count(enrollments) * 100.0
    numStudents: Int     = count(enrollments)
  }
  
  entity Enrollment {
    name       : String  = course.name + " " +student.name
    
    grade      : Float?
    pass       : Boolean = grade >= 5.5 <+ false
    pass2      : Int     = pass ? 1 : 0
  }
  
  relation Course.enrollments *  <-> 1 Enrollment.course
  relation Student.enrollments * <-> 1 Enrollment.student

data

  alice : Student {
    name = "Alice"
  }
  bob : Student {
    name = "Bob"
  }
  charlie : Student {
    name = "Charlie"
  }
  math : Course {
    name = "Math"
    enrollments = 
      enA {
        student = alice
        grade = 8.0
      },
      enB {
        student = bob
        grade = 9.5
      },
      enC {
        student = charlie
        grade = 5.0
      }
  }
  
execute

  math.name
  math.avgGrade
  math.passPerc
  math.numStudents
```

The example describes a system in the `model` section with students, courses and enrollment-relations between students and courses. The `pass` attribute in Enrollment and the `averageGrade` attribute in Course are _derived values_. Based on the compiler settings these are eagerly, lazily or eventually computed.

The `data` section describes the default data for the system, and the `execute` section triggers computation for the Java compiler.

The type system is aware of _multiplicities_ (the number of values an expression can yield). Expression `grade >= 6 <+ false` has a multiplicity of [1,1]. Since `grade` has multiplicity [0,1] `grade >= 5.5` has multiplicity [0,1]. The choice operator (`<+`) takes the second operand if the first one returns no values. Thus `grade >= 5.5 <+ false` has multiplicity [1,1].

## Getting the Editor

Download from http://buildfarm.metaborg.org/job/metaborgcube/job/IceDust-EclipseGen/job/master/

Or build the Editor (in Spoofax)

1. Get Spoofax from http://buildfarm.metaborg.org/job/metaborg/job/spoofax-releng/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dist/spoofax/eclipse/
2. Check out this git repo
3. Build the Spoofax Language Project in [icedust](icedust)

## Try the Examples

See the [icedust.examples](icedust.examples).

There are three backends:

* Java backend: Generates Java classes for the `model`, and generates code for the `data` and `execute` sections.
  * Use 1: use the `execute` section and use the stdout output
  * Use 2: only use `model` and `data`, and use the generated Java code in a Java project
* WebDSL backed: Generate WebDSL entities for `model` and `data` (ignores `execute`)
  * Standalone Application: generates a Create Read Update Delete interface
  * Embedded Model: generates extend-entities for embedding in a WebDSL application

### Java backend

To use the Java backend use the menu `Spoofax > Generation > to Java > Calculate on Read > Generate, Compile and Execute`.

Or use `Spoofax > Generation > to Java > Calculate on Read > Generate` to generate Java code (make sure the generated Java files are on the classpath and that your eclipse project has the Java nature and Java builder).

### WebDSL backend - Standalone Application (CRUD-interface)

Compiling to WebDSL requires you to have the IceDust file the same name as the project name (case sensitive) and to be in the root folder of the project:

```
Demo (project name)
Demo/Demo.rel (icedust file)
Demo/Demo.app (generated WebDSL file)
```

And `Demo.rel`:

```
module Demo

model

  //...
```

1. Use `Spoofax > Generation > to WebDSL > Calculate on Read > Generate, Standalone Application` to generate the `.app` file.
2. Import the project in the [WebDSL editor](http://buildfarm.metaborg.org/job/webdsl-eclipsegen/).
3. Convert the project to a WebDSL project by right-clicking the project in the WebDSL editor.
4. Press `Cmd + Alt + B` in the `.app` file to trigger the WebDSL compiler, the compiler will build the project and automatically launch a webserver and open the main web page of the application.

Known issue: the CRUD interface does not work properly for optional values (all values are required), and also not for default values (as those are optional as well).

### WebDSL backend - Embedded Model

Use `Spoofax > Generation > to WebDSL > Calculate on Read > Generate, Embedded Model` to generate the `.app` file.

You need to create a main `.app` file that includes the generated `.app` file.
The generated `.app` file has `extend` entities, so the main `.app` file needs to define the entities to the generated code can extend these.
