module weblabTest2

// A simplified model of a grade calculation and course statistics tool in the university.
//
// It features:
//  - weighted average grades, for example the course grade is 70% exam and 30% practical
//  - optional minimum grades, for example the exam and practical both need to be at least a 5.0 before a course grade is given
//  - optional deadlines and deadline extensions, if an assignment is turned in after a deadline but before the deadline extension a grade penalty is applied. If the assignment is turned in after the deadline extension, no grade.
//  - personal deadlines and deadline extensions, teachers can assign students a personal deadline
//  - assignment and course statistics
